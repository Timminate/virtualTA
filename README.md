# Virtual-TA
**CS 4485 Capstone Project**

## About This Project
Virtual TA is an intelligent chatbot with intended use in an educational environment. The idea behind this project is to explore the use of AI in education to provide basic to complex support for not only students, but also instructors and teaching assistants. This is to combat an increasing student population in ECS which may be overwhelming to instructors and teaching assistants due to an abundance of inquiries regarding the course and subject matter compared to the number of students not many years before. The Virtual TA will be implemented using Pythonâ€™s Chatterbot library and will be a hybrid of both a rule-based and self-learning nature. This specific iteration will focus on the Data Structures and Algorithms course, and it will be able to answer general inquiries about the subject as well as course logistics while also not sacrificing educational honor and integrity.
